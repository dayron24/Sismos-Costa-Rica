# National Earthquake Information System

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, aiming to create an application using Java that provides information about earthquakes occurring in the national territory. The main goal is to gather relevant data on earthquake behavior and perform information analysis processes that support decision-making for emergency and prevention programs in high-incidence areas.

## Features

The application records and analyzes essential information about each earthquake, including:

- **Date of Occurrence**: Day, month, and year when the earthquake happened.
- **Exact Time**: Hour, minute, and second when the earthquake occurred.
- **Depth**: Measured in kilometers.
- **Fault Origin**: The origin of the earthquake can be classified as:
  - Subduction
  - Plate Collision
  - Tectonic due to local fault
  - Intraplate
  - Internal Deformation
- **Magnitude**: The earthquake's magnitude is measured using the local Richter scale if it ranges between 2.0 and 6.9.
- **Location**:
  - Latitude and longitude expressed in degrees.
  - Detailed description of the epicenter area, including the province where the epicenter originated.
  - Distinguishes between terrestrial and maritime origins if no province is recorded.

## Usage

### For Analysts and Decision Makers:
- Access detailed information on past earthquakes.
- Perform analysis to identify patterns and high-risk areas.
- Support emergency and prevention program decisions based on historical data.

### For Researchers:
- Utilize the detailed earthquake records for academic studies.
- Analyze fault origins and their impacts on earthquake characteristics.
